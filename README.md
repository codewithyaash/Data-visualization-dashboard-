const fetchDataFromDatabase = require('./fetchData');

// Call the fetchDataFromDatabase function to fetch data
fetchDataFromDatabase()
  .then(data => {
    // Handle fetched data
    console.log('Fetched data:', data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Handle error
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);

Data Visualization Dashboard
This repository contains a React component for a Data Visualization Dashboard. The component is designed to fetch data from a database and display it in a tabular format. It leverages React hooks for state management and utilizes asynchronous data fetching.

Features
Asynchronous Data Fetching: Utilizes the useEffect hook to fetch data from a database asynchronously when the component mounts.

Loading Indicator: Displays a loading indicator while data is being fetched to provide feedback to the user.

Dynamic Data Display: Renders the fetched data dynamically in a tabular format, making it easy to visualize and analyze.

Installation
To use the Dashboard component in your React application, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd data-visualization-dashboard
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Usage
Import the Dashboard component into your React application and render it as needed. Ensure that your backend provides the necessary API endpoints for fetching data.

javascript
Copy code
import Dashboard from './Dashboard';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Dashboard />
    </div>
  );
}
